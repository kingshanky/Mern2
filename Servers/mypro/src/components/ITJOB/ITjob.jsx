  <h4> What is coding?  </h4>

<ul>

  <p>  Coding is the act of writing instructions that a computer must follow, or you can say "Coding" is a term used for computer programming. Some people use it interchangeably in programming, while others will claim that they are not the same.   </p>

  <p> By definition, "code" refers to a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do. Computers do not understand human language, so over time people have created languages ​​that computers understand. And developers communicate with them through languages.
    If you learn to code, you will be able to write instructions that will be followed by computers. It allows you to create websites, applications and software and do other great things. 
  </p>

<br/>

</ul>

   <h4> What is programming? </h4>

<ul>

     <p> Many developers consider programming to be a more advanced term than coding, and many others use two words interchangeably.

Programming is still about writing the instructions that a computer follows, but now data structures and algorithms are important. Some coding languages ​​such as HTML, CSS, and Markdown do not use algorithms and data structures, while others, such as JavaScript, Python, Java, and C ++, make extensive use of them. This brings a difference created by many developers. In the web development industry, many developers do not consider HTML a "programming language" in the strict sense, because it does not make sense. It simply defines the structure of the site.

On the other hand, languages ​​like JavaScript, Python, C ++ and Java are all "official" programming languages ​​because they handle complex applications and interactivity.

Some developers refer to anyone who encodes only HTML and CSS as coders, and those who encode in JavaScript, Java, C ++, and other programming languages ​​as programmers. But not everyone feels that way, so it's important to do your own research and learn this skill before you take sides

  <h4> Why should you learn to code?  </h4>
  <ul>
  <p> The world has become a world village. And coding is a big reason why this happens. There are many reasons why you should know how to code, and I will touch on a few of them here.
  </p> 

</ul>

  <ul>

  {/* <h6>  First, learning the code will improve your analysis and problem-solving skills. </h6>    */}


   <li>
     <h5> Your revenue potential will grow  </h5>
     
     <p>  There are experienced developers who earn $ 600,000 a year. That if you learn to code, you can live your dreams and be financially secure.
 </p>
 
   </li>



   <li>  
     <h5> You can work with the biggest technology companies: </h5>
      <p>  Learn to code for opening doors so that you can work with the biggest technology companies, such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. If you are a FAANG fan, you should consider learning the code.
  </p>
  
   </li>
   

     <li>  
        <h5> You can work independently:</h5>
        <p>  Many developers have many years of experience in their respective industries and have never worked for a person or company as an employee. By working for yourself, you work according to your own schedule, at your own pace, and according to your own conditions.
 </p>
     </li>

  </ul>
