               <h4> Word Association Test (WAT) </h4>   <p> candidate are expected to write sentence or phrases they feel suitable on 15 seconds given to write answers for each word.
                         It is clearly the hardest among the battery of mental tests in SSB interview. The trouble level is more in light of the fact that as far as possible given for each word is only 15 secs. We are assume to think and compose a sentence in light of the word displayed to us. On the off chance that you do without training, you might feel a trouble to compose great sentences. You may likewise pass up a major opportunity few words or screw up with the chronic number of words. Be that as it may, assuming you go with appropriate practice, it will be extremely simple for you to compose great sentences without missing or composing terrible sentences.
                       Here we are giving you unique words being displayed during Word Association Test at different SSB like Allahabad, Bhopal, Bangalore, Varanasi, Dehradun, Mysore and so forth This rundown covers practically 95% of words gets show during WAT. Being a repeater you probably saw that SSB don't change Word Association Test (WAT) words and a large portion of the words are like what you have confronted before. Thus, assuming you practice this large number of words, it will be simple for you to break word affiliation test without dealing with any issue.
