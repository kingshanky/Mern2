<p> Indian Administrative Service (IAS) is the dream career of millions of aspirants in the country. The same is the case with services like Indian Police Service (IPS), Indian Foreign Service (IFS) etc.
 Recruitment to 24 services including IAS, IPS, IFS etc is conducted via a common exam called the UPSC Civil Services Exam (CSE).
  Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is the Central Authority that takes care of the entire recruitment process.  </p>

<p> First of all, you should decide how will you learn for UPSC CSE – whether it will be entirely by self-study, or by taking proper training, or a combination of both. 
  CSE is the examination which help in the recruitment of our future bureaucrates of our country which help us in running the administration and law and order of the country effectively and efficiently. A white colour job with a lot of responsibility and power as well.   </p>

 <p>  First, the syllabus: download it. If you want, keep reading early in the morning. But once a day it has to go through. Don't learn, just keep going.

Purpose: If you see an article or something related, you can link it to an outline and it will determine the level of interest. Second, optional: decide on your optional.

The result: In major history, 2016, I reached 242 and that was a time when I could not prepare for the level I wanted. If you do not like such a topic, go to last year's optional paper. Choose a topic whose questions you can easily answer or whose questions you will ask to find the answer.

After completing these 2, it's time to produce the material. There are 2 types of materials - STATIC & DYNAMIC.

Main material: Questionnaires in years. For preliminary and main network. Just walk through them. You will learn about the UPSC standard, the type of questions they ask, and your mind will be directed to viewing each study material the way you would like the UPSC to receive an answer.

Dynamic part: These are current activities. Preliminary and key papers from previous years will tell you that this is the most important part. Read one of the following newspapers: The Hindu, Indian Express or The Hindustan Times. Each of the magazines: Yojana or Kurukshetra.

Write down the key points you find here, or highlight them and cut out the articles. Anything that is comfortable for you and you feel takes up the curriculum and complements the UPSC's requirement, as you know from documents from previous years.

You must read the book of the year in India and economic research. Emphasize important points and keep repeating.

Static part: These books need to be edited so many times that every question asked should be known without looking at the possibilities. It's extremely point.

History: Black Oriental Swan Bipin Chandra, Penguin Bipin Chandra India's Struggle for Independence, Ancient Ncerts, Norman Lowe for World History, Selected Chapters from India's Bipin Chandras After Independence. Geography: NCERTS, Majyd Hussain, Mrunal (includes everything. Watch Mrunal videos on YouTube, download and learn.)

Economics: NCERTS, Mrunal.

Principles: NCERTS and Laxmikant.

Environment: NCERTS, daily news and notes. Internal security, international relations, science and technology should be studied through current activities.

CSAT: If you're strong in math, keep practicing and make it perfect. Practice various understandings, reasoning, analytical skills, Arihanta's mathematics or TMH. Only practice can get you through CSAT

Join a series of tests for the preliminary round and the main. Don't worry about scores and ratings. Just deal with them so that you are aware of your weaknesses.

Connect only once for a series of network tests. This will give you an idea of ​​the basic mistakes and avoid them. The problem that arose was that your personal identity was lost and I paid for it. Everyone around me in the web lobby has completed the Vision web test series. The examiner found nothing out of the ordinary in my answers. So there are no unique characters. You have to keep your uniqueness because you have to go into the top 100 out of 15,000.

In the meantime, I had a history of an optional written answer in the middle and received good grades. They never gave me more than 80 per throw, which undermined my confidence. Once you learn your basic mistakes, avoid them, take what you feel will help you, mix it with your style, a style that suits you and respond to it. Development will take time. It took me 4 months to forget parts of what the vision taught me and create a new pattern for myself.

Interview: Do not engage in a false interview. They will go for the "knowledge test", while the Upsc will go for the "personality test". Some successful candidates were given "no hope" in mockery, but were interviewed by one of the highest.

The mentality of the UPSC interviewers is such that they will spend the next day in office. They will not come ready. This day is important for you, but for them it is just a day. They will only show you how to answer the questions.

<p>              

However, even silent preparation is a more difficult process than spoon feeding from Coaching Institutes, it is the best option you can get.

Before you start your own studio, the month is your warm-up period, during which you will read the basic NCERTS (6th to 10th) and The Hind or Indian Express, which are already available. Read it carefully. (Don't worry if you don't understand)
You will get an honest idea of ​​things to read. Then, after a month, you have to start preparing.
Get a copy of the copy of the syllabus. Alone.
Take the last 5 years of preliminary and main interviews. And analyze them. You can divide the questions under the topics you have read.
Try to answer the questions of everything you read. and try to relate what you read. You don't correlate much because you just read books and don't understand them.
At this point, you should complete the optional ones, study the questionnaires, and gather materials.
For a GS course, no more than 300 to 400 hours to complete all courses.
The next step after analyzing the interviews is to seriously start studying. Get NCERTS. Take last year's interviews. Read last year's questions and then make a note of the certificates. NCERT should now be from the 6th to the 12th certificate.
As you follow the curriculum, you can relate the keywords in the curriculum to those in the newspaper and make daily notes from the newspaper .
You will need to continue with the default books once the certificates are complete. The list of books is: Benjamin Kallolikar's Response to What's My Book List for UPSC Mains ?. 3. Tips to follow:

Regular study 8 to 10 hours a day.
Check topics weekly.

<p>  
 

First, the syllabus: download it. Keep reading it first thing in the morning or whenever you feel like. But once a day, it should be gone through. Don’t learn, just go through.

Purpose: Whenever you see an article or anything relevant, you will be able to connect it with the syllabus and this decide the level of importance.

Second, optional: Decide your optional.

How? Any subject that you feel attracted to. A subject, which you enjoy reading. A subject, whose books when you read, you have no idea about the time.

My optional is history. I get so engrossed that sometimes I see historical characters in my dream. Once I saw Shivaji Maharaj telling me “kahan the itni der? Jung ke liye tayyar ho jao.” (Where were you all this time? Get ready for war.)

Result: I scored 242 in history in mains, 2016 and that is when I could not prepare myself to the level which I wanted.

If you don’t have such a subject, go through last year optional papers. Choose the subject whose questions you can answer easily or whose questions create an urge in you to know the answer.

After these 2 are done, it’s time to get material ready. There are 2 kinds of material- STATIC & DYNAMIC.

Most important material: PREVIOUS YEARS QUESTION PAPERS !!!For both pre and mains. Just keep going through them. You will come to know about the pattern of UPSC, the kind of questions they ask and your mind will be channelled to look at every piece of study material in the way UPSC wants you to answer.

Dynamic Portion: This is current affairs. Previous years prelims and mains paper will tell you it’s the most important part. Read any of the following newspapers: The Hindu, Indian Express or The Hindustan Times.

Any of the magazines: Yojana or Kurukshetra.

Jot down the important points you find here, or highlight them and cut the articles. Whatever is comfortable for you and u feel covers the syllabus and completes demand of UPSC as you find out from previous years papers.

Dont spend more than 2 hours everyday. Keep revising them.

India Year book and Economic Survey needs to be read. Highlight important points and keep revising.

Static portion: These books need to be revised so many times that any question asked should be known without looking at options. This is extremely scoring.

History: Black Orient Swan Bipin Chandra, Penguin Bipin Chandra India’s struggle for Independence, old NCERTS, Norman Lowe for World History, selective chapters from Bipin Chandras India after independence.

Geography: NCERTS, Majyd Hussain, Mrunal(covers everything. Look at YouTube videos of Mrunal and download and learn.)

Economy: NCERTS(learn appendix according to questions in prelims), Mrunal (this is one coaching videos I recommend everyone. Selfless help).

Polity: NCERTS and Laxmikant.

Environment: NCERTS, everyday news and notes.

Internal Security, International Relations, Science and Tech need to be studies through current affairs.

CSAT: if strong in math, keep practicing and make it perfect. If not, practice comprehension, reasoning, analytical ability, math from Arihant or TMH. Only practice will get you through in CSAT

Join test series for both prelims and mains. Don’t worry about marks and rank. Just join them to know your weaknesses.

For mains test series, join only once. So that you get the idea of basic mistakes and avoid them. Problem that arises is that your personal uniqueness gets quashed and I paid dearly with it. Everyone around me in mains test hall had taken Vision mains test series. Examiner found nothing unique in my answers. Hence there were no unique marks. You need to maintain your uniqueness, as you need to go to top 100 in 15,000.

While, I left history optional answer writing half way and got pretty decent marks. They never gave me more than 80 per paper which was disturbing my confidence.

After learning your basic mistakes, avoid them, take whatever you feel will help you, mix it up with your style, style with which you are comfortable with and answer in that. It will take time to develop. It took me 4 months to forget parts of what Vision has taught me and make a new pattern for myself.

Interview: don’t join any mock interviews. They go for “test of knowledge” while Upsc goes for “test of personality”. There are some successful candidates who were told “hopeless” in mocks but got one of the highest in interview.

Mentality of interviewers in UPSC is that they are just spending another day in office. They don’t come prepared. It’s important day for you but for them, it’s just another day. They just see how you tackle questions.

<p>

Although, Preparing on self is a quiet a tough process than the spoon feeding one gets from the Coaching Institutes, it is the best option you have got.

Here are the few things i would like to suggest :

Before you start the real studies, one month should be your warm up period, where you will read basic NCERTS(from 6th to 10th) and The Hindu or Indian Express, which ever is available. Give it a light headed reading.(Do not worry if you don’t understand anything)
You will get fair idea of things to read. Then after the one month period, You got to start your preparation.
Take a printout of the syllabus copy. Byheart it.
Get the past 5 years question papers of Prelims and Mains. And analyse them. You can segregate questions under the subjects you have read.
Try answering the questions from what all you have read. and try to correlate with what you have read. You wouldn't correlate much because you have just read through books and not understand it.
By this time you should have finalized the optional, analysed the question papers and collected the materials.
For the GS subject it does not take more than 300 to 400 hours to finish all the subjects.
The next step after you analyse the question papers is start the studies seriously.
Take up the NCERTs . Take up the previous year question papers. Read the questions from previous year and then make notes out of ncerts. Now the NCERTs need to be from 6th to 12th ncerts.(This should not take you more than 2 months)
Since you have byhearted the syllabus, you can relate to the key words in syllabus and to those of the newspaper and make notes out of newspaper daily.(This is the golden step.)
After you are thorough with ncerts, you should move on to the standard books. The book list is:Benjamin Kallolikar's answer to What should be my booklist for UPSC Mains?.
3. Tips to be followed:

Regular studies of 8 to 10 hours daily.(Nrewspaper notes making is not studying)
Revising the topics every weekend.
Have a look at PIB and PRS website on regular basis.
Reading one subject at a time or maximum 2.
4. Answer writing is must:

For initial stages, you can start by writing answers for the questions given in the back of each chapter in NCERTs.
After reading an editorial in news paper, think of what question arises from that editorial. Try answering that question in your own words.
After you are thorough with the standard books(Which should not take more than 3 months), take up the UPSC questions and solve them.
You can refer various websites which post the questions and give answers next day.
5. Prelims Solving:

Before taking up and after finishing one must always look at the previous prelims questions and think on what lines the questions can be asked.
If possible try framing the questions by yourselves.
Before 3 months of prelims exam, one must solve as many as questions from various institutions and past 15 year question papers must be solved.
